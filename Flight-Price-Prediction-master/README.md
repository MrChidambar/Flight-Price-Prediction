Description
This project involves various steps to analyze and predict flight prices. The key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset.

Model Creation: Building and training machine learning models to predict flight prices.

Steps to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/MrChidambar/Flight-Price-Prediction.git
cd Flight-Price-Prediction
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
bash
conda create -n flight_price_prediction python=3.7 -y
conda activate flight_price_prediction
Step 3: Install the Requirements
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the Notebooks
You can open and run the Jupyter notebook (FlightPredMembers.ipynb) to replicate the analysis.

Step 5: Train the Model
After running the notebook, you can use the final processed data to train your machine learning model and make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of Data_Train.xlsx and Test_set.xlsx files. These files contain various features related to flight details and prices.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to predict flight prices. By following the steps provided, you can replicate the analysis and build your own predictive model for flight prices.
